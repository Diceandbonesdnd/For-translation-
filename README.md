# Localization project by Diceandbones DND

This repository stores files for translation/localization of the original DnD sources

All translations are perfomed using the Crowdin service, the name of the project is DiceandbonesWebsite

Crowdin automatically uploads the localized files to the ***transition_branch***

### Translation guidelines

1. A string containing only numbers simply needs to be copied and saved to count towards the translation percentage
2. Constructions of the format ***{@*text*}*** must be omitted (no translation needed)
3. Acronyms (such as PHB, AC, LVL) and multi-letter values (such as V, M, C, U) should be omitted. These values are commonly used as references. They should be translated separately.
4. Use and add new translations to project's ***Glossary***.
